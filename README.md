# Remote Pay Cloud Starter

This repository contains a sample web application that uses Clover Connector to connect to a Clover device and perform basic operations.

To clone this repository, enter the following on the command line:

    git clone git@github.com:clover/remote-pay-cloud-examples.git
    cd remote-pay-cloud-starter
   
Next, you can build and run the application locally with the following commands:
  
    npm install
    npm run build
    npm start 
    
If you are prompted to download the webpack-cli, select yes.       
    
This will start a local server on port 3000. You can then navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
